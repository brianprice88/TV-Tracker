# TV-Tracker

How often have you discovered a great show, only to feel burdened by having to keep up with your progress watching it? Whether you start in the middle and try to play catch up, or find out about the new season of one of your favorites by the time it's multiple episodes in, staying on top of one series' schedule is hard enough. And in this era of peak TV with so many programs to choose from? Good luck with that!

TV Tracker makes it easy to know what episodes to watch of what shows, and when. Users can select shows to add to their favorites list, then check off episodes they've watched and know what episodes are available. There is the additional option to subscribe to new episode updates, in which case the user receives an email notification on the day a show's latest episode is scheduled to air. No more struggling to recall if you've actually seen this before - now you can mark your progress as you go! And instead of having to scour the listings to figure out if that new episode is on today, tomorrow, or not until next year - get reminders when you can tune in!
